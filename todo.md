- create high resolution texture for globe

- finish individual Project component
- go through api data and dynamically create the project cards

- get svgs for all technologies
- receive their names from api
- display them

- BUGS:
    - mobile nav bar fucks with the formatting of globe
    - globe should be small on mobile, looks weird when too big
    - text is a little hard to read, needs more text shadow
